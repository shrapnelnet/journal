            <h1>Study Skills</h1>
            <p>This semester, I think the largest new skills I've learned have been library skills and referencing.</p>
            <p>During my essay, I had to learn how to properly find, implement and cite references in the Harvard style which was totally new to me at the time. The University OneSearch functionality was an excellent help for finding relevant sources, as well as Google Scholar.</p>
            <p>In general, the library was an excellent help too. I withdrew several books on web design and accessibility on the web which greatly aided in me creating a screen reader friendly experience.</p>
