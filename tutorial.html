            <h1>Study Skills</h1>
            <p>This semester, I think the largest new skills I've learned have been library skills and referencing.</p>
            <p>During my essay, I had to learn how to properly find, implement and cite references in the Harvard style which was totally new to me at the time. The University OneSearch functionality was an excellent help for finding relevant sources, as well as Google Scholar.</p>
            <p>In general, the library was an excellent help too. I withdrew several books on web design and accessibility on the web which greatly aided in me creating a screen reader friendly experience.</p>
            <p>While creating the site, I made an effort to test each page at every common breakpoint. I used this to create a flexible experience on the site so that no content overflows the main content div. I also made a marked effort to use semantic elements as to better aid those users who are visually depaired. These include time, cite, code, main, footer etc.</p>
            <p>The entire site validates using the W3C CSS and HTML validators and has at each stage of development.</p>
            <p>I have an excellent understanding of licensing within software, the site is copyleft licensed and each image used is licensed under CC and is correctly attributed to the original authors, and otherwise all images used are uncopyrighted or in the public domain and do not require attribution.</p>
            <p>Overall, I think I have created an excellent experience on my site, not just usable but well functioning on the vast majority of devices, with the correct meta tags, compartmentalised images and static assets, webfonts, and semantic HTML. I hope you enjoy reading through it.</p>
