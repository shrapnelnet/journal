                <h4>Week Six - <time datetime="2023-11-05">05/11/2023</time></h4>
                <p>This week, I had to migrate my static assets away from Google cloud platform.</p>
                <p>This involved the following actions:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>I disabled my Google Cloud Platform billing account</li>
                    <li>I migrated the static assets to Cloudflare R2</li>
                    <li>I set up a CORS policy on the bucket to allow cross-origin requests to it</li>
                    <li>I rewrote all the old url paths to the new R2 public URLs.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>I also wrote CSS to make the site mobile first as so:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>I made the heading collapse into flex-display column below a mobile breakpoint</li>
                    <li>The main content is mobile safe using a fixed width as to keep consistency</li>
                    <li>I hid the table on mobile viewports due to its inflexibility</li>
                    <li>All relevant meta tags are included in the head</li>
                </ol>
                <p>On top of this, I included these changes:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>I organized all CSS files into independent folders</li>
                    <li>All images are flexible and will not overflow their containers (max-width)</li>
                </ol>

                <h4>Week Five - <time datetime="2023-10-29">29/10/2023</time>:</h4>
                <p>This week, I had already added font fallbacks for all platforms, so I instead added breakpoint fixes and other misc changes.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>I hid the table on mobile viewports where it would refuse to shrink. This is a temporary fix for now.</li>
                    <li>I migrated my font from local hosting to a CDN which globally distributes my static resources at an edge server close to the request origin to speed up loading. I did this using Google cloud platform storage buckets over a load balancer.</li>
                    <li>I used float to reorient this image to the right</li>
                </ol>
                <figure>

                    <p>This is a landscape in tunisia. The image floats right !</p>

                <h4>Week Four - <time datetime="2023-10-22">22/10/2023</time>:</h4>
                <p>This week, I created custom CSS for the webpage in my favourite style reminiscent of the 2000s web (or 'webrevival' affectionately)</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>I added a background image</li>
                    <li>I used flexbox to create a responsive navbar</li>
                    <li>I removed bullet points and the margin they add</li>
                    <li>I implemented a custom font using the optimised for web format WOFF with @font-face</li>
                    <li>I used colour to highlight certain elements like spans and anchors</li>
                    <li>I added media queries to fix the navbar and content window on mobile viewports</li>
                    <li>I added the relevant meta tags to keep content working on mobile</li>
                    <li>I moved the table inline style to CSS</li>
                    <li>I minified normalize and included its source map to speed up load times</li>
                    <li>I added suitable font fallbacks to ensure relevant fonts are always applied</li>
                    <li>I specified font-display in @font-face to make sure that on downloading the font, the load will be non-blocking (using fallback)</li>
                </ol>

                <h4>Week Three - <time datetime="2023-10-15">15/10/2023</time>:</h4>
                <p>Today I learned about more types of lists within HTML.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>I implemented a description list.</li>
                    <li>I created a table to represent my timetable and read up on legacy css like float hacks.</li>
                    <li>I added a section for quotes and used the blockquote and cite elements.</li>
                </ol>
                <dl>
                    <dt>&lt;dl&gt;<dt>
                    <dd>Description list. An element designed to form sections of a page like glossaries to define terms.</dd>

                <h5>My favourite quote:</h5>
                <blockquote>
                    <p><span class="speaker">Brick Top:</span> You're always gonna have problems lifting a body in one piece. Apparently the best thing to do is cut up a corpse into six pieces and pile it all together.</p>
                    <p><span class="speaker">Sol:</span> Would someone mind telling me, who are you?</p>
                    <p><span class="speaker">Brick Top:</span> And when you got your six pieces, you gotta get rid of them, because it's no good leaving it in the deep freeze for your mum to discover, now is it? Then I hear the best thing to do is feed them to pigs. You got to starve the pigs for a few days, then the sight of a chopped-up body will look like curry to a pi**head. You gotta shave the heads of your victims, and pull the teeth out for the sake of the piggies' digestion. You could do this afterwards, of course, but you don't want to go sievin' through pig s**t, now do you? They will go through bone like butter. You need at least sixteen pigs to finish the job in one sitting, so be wary of any man who keeps a pig farm. They will go through a body that weighs 200 pounds in about eight minutes. That means that a single pig can consume two pounds of uncooked flesh every minute. Hence the expression, "as greedy as a pig".</p>
                    <p><span class="speaker">Vinny:</span> Well, thank you for that. That's a great weight off me mind. Now, if you wouldn't mind telling me who the f**k you are, apart from someone who feeds people to pigs of course?</p>

                <p>This week, I added more features to the html skeleton.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>I implemented this list to better display how i am doing things</li>
                    <li>I added a mailto link to the footer</li>
                    <li>I added the semantic elements, <code>&lt;time&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;code&gt;</code></li>
                    <li>I used escape codes like lt, gt and copy.</li>
                    <li>I added an image using semantic elements like <code>&lt;figure&gt;</code></li>
                    <li>I attributed the image correctly under the creative commons</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Here is the page:</p>

                <p>After finishing the first tutorial, I wrote up a basic html skeleton and created a good file structure</p>
                <p>This is my webpage without styling:</p>
                <img src="/img/week1/week1.PNG" alt="screenshot of a barebones webpage without styling">

                <p>Finally, here is the w3c validator confirming that the html is valid:</p>
